### Setup

Before running any commands make sure you have `docker` installed on your system.

Once you've checked that out write following commands in project directory:
1. Configure environment (repeat every time you restart your terminal seesion):
```sh
source ./configure
```
2. Setup project (this creates Python's virtual environment, installs requirements, starts database and runs django migrations):
```sh
setup
```
3. To simplify interaction with the project you may use (equvivalent to `python manage.py`):
```sh
medagg
```
